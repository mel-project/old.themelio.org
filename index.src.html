                <h2>Uncompromising stability</h2>
                <p>Consensus-breaking updates, like “hard forks” and “protocol upgrades”, weaken the very basis of blockchains’ decentralized, trustless security and destabilize whole ecosystems. The unprecedented revolution in trust promised by blockchains can only be unlocked with a robust, stable protocol carefully engineered to <strong>not need change</strong>.</p>
                <p>Themelio’s incredibly simple data model means no parameter-tweaking hard forks. BFT proof of stake built on a novel, collusion-proof game-theoretical model ensures immediate finality and resilient decentralization, eliminating the need to recover from attacks through forks. And future-proof cryptography allows Themelio to survive unforeseen cryptoanalytic breakthroughs.</p>

                <h2>Usable and performant</h2>
                <p>Themelio’s low-level UTXO-based data model is far from the limited, payment-focused models of blockchains like Bitcoin and Litecoin. MelVM, a Turing-incomplete yet expressive covenant language, empowers complex dApps with stronger security guarantees and higher performance than smart contracts in platforms based on mutable state, like Ethereum and Cardano. Usability is further enhanced by straightforward, easy-to-understand blockchain semantics. Themelio eliminates unintuitive corner-cases, like block reorganizations, common in other blockchains, makes it easy to build tall application stacks without frustration.</p>
                <p>And despite Themelio being a traditional one-shard blockchain, apps using it can easily achieve great performance with its design that can secure layer-2 protocols without deploying full nodes. Even layer-1 usage benefits from a data model engineered for maximum performance through techniques like fully parallel transaction validation.</p>
