                <h2>A blockchain built to last</h2>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    Unlike centralized services, <b>blockchain protocols can&rsquo;t really be updated</b>.
                    &ldquo;Protocol governance&rdquo; is really about getting a whole community to collectively switch to a different protocol.
                </p>
                <p class="text--lead">And as with most collective action, contention, drama, and politics rule the day.</p>
                <p class="text--lead">Worse, externally coordinated upgrades undermine the most important innovation of blockchains &mdash; endogenous trust based on internal incentives, not external communities or authorities.</p>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    Instead, <b>Themelio is designed not to change</b>. That means a low-level, robust blockchain inspired by the Internet's core protocols, providing an immutable root of trust, security, and transparency to a diverse ecosystem.

                <h3>Radical immutability</h3>
                <p class="text-left">Consensus-breaking updates, like “hard forks” and “protocol upgrades”, ultimately force all blockchain users to <a href="https://nullchinchilla.me/against-blockchain-governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rely on external trusted parties</a> for protocol security. This weakens the very basis of blockchains’ decentralized, trustless security and destabilizes whole ecosystems.</p>
                <p class="text-left">The unprecedented revolution in trust promised by blockchains can only be unlocked with a robust, stable protocol carefully engineered for <strong>radical immutability</strong>. Themelio’s incredibly simple data model means no parameter-tweaking hard forks. A novel, collusion-proof proof-of-stake consensus ensures immediate finality and resilient decentralization. And future-proof cryptography allows Themelio to survive unforeseen cryptoanalytic breakthroughs.</p>

                <h3>Revolutionary cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p class="text-left">Themelio’s base currency, Mel, is the <strong>world’s first truly decentralized, fiat-independent stablecoin</strong>. Melmint, a fully trustless, oracle-free issuance mechanism, stabilizes a mel’s value against an index representing the time cost of sequential computation.</p>
                <p class="text-left">A decentralized stable-value asset completely demolishes the false dichotomy between trustless issuance and low volatility. With money that is independent of both the systemic risk of oracle-based fiat pegs and the extreme volatility of conventional cryptocurrencies, Themelio promises a fundamental breakthrough in decentralized financial applications.</p>

                <h3>Usability with performance</h3>
                <p class="text-left">Themelio provides a uniquely flexible and usable UTXO-based data model. MelVM, a Turing-incomplete yet expressive covenant language, empowers complex dApps with stronger security guarantees and higher performance. Straightforward semantics eliminate unintuitive corner-cases like block reorganizations and volatile fees, making it easy to build tall application stacks without frustration.</p>
                <p class="text-left">And despite Themelio being a traditional one-shard blockchain, apps using it can easily achieve great performance with its design that can secure layer-2 protocols without deploying full nodes. Even layer-1 usage benefits from a data model engineered for maximum performance through techniques like fully parallel transaction validation.</p>
