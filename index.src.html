                    Themelio is the low-level foundation for a new decentralized Internet. It's a blockchain designed
                    the way blockchains should always have been --- like a core network protocol. Themelio is simple,
                    future-proof, and ridiculously robust, just like the Internet Protocol.

                    Right now, decentralized app developers face terrible options.

                <p>
                    You could spend years engineering and refining a specialized ledger protocol just for your specific use case, like Satoshi Nakamoto did with Bitcoin and payments. You'll probably still make something insecure, hard to use, and impossible to evolve.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or you could use a general-purpose blockchain like Ethereum or EOS, where Turing-complete smart contract support seems to let you write a few dozen lines of code and let the blockchain handle the rest. But then come the poor performance, high costs, unintuitive behavior, and worst of all, disruptive and contentious updates. You'll probably end up wishing you could trust somebody else's computer after all.
