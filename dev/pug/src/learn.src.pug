The protocol can never be changed or upgraded, ensuring absolute trust by the developers and applications built on top that the architecture will always support decentralization and security.

        h2 What is Themelio?
        p().
            Themelio is a decentralized, public blockchain designed to serve as a low-level, stable, 
            and radically simple base layer for an application ecosystem. 
            Themelio's goal is to ensure endogenous trust, which can be achieved 
            only through radical immutability. No governance process or developer
            updates can change the Themelio blockchain once it is launched, ensuring unprecedented trust in any 
            application or solution built on top.
            Three overarching features enable Themelio to power a paradigm shift in Web3: an improved UXTO model, a novel PoS consensus mechanism, and an algorithmic stablecoin not pegged to any government currency.

        h3 Endogenous Trust
        p The foundation of Themelio's minimal blockchain. Endogenous trust describes the ability to trust that a blockchain network will behave in a particular way without needing to trust or know who is running it. Among many of today's leading L1 blockchains, endogenous trust does not exist — protocols can be changed, updated, and altered through built-in mechanisms. Above all else, Themelio is architectured to endow the ecosystem built on top of it with endogenous trust.
