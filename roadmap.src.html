                <h2>Phases of development</h2>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    The most distinctive part about Themelio's development plans is our four phases of development.
                </p>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    Our first step is to make a <b>prototype</b>, ending in Q3 2019. This gives us a proof-of-concept to tinker with and to base our production software off of. At this point, development is highly "agile" and prioritizes flexibility over stability &mdash; we won't even have completely specified protocols or feature sets.
                </p>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    Next we launch a public <b>alphanet</b>. This will be a fully peer-to-peer blockchain network, albeit with centralized consensus and no guarantee of a consistent history, like the Bitcoin testnet. The alphanet will let us experiment with tweaking and optimizing the protocol for real mass usage.
                </p>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    The <b>betanet</b> will launch in Q4 2019 with a brand-new history, while the alphanet will become a testnet with no persistency. In the betanet, history consistency is guaranteed, while consensus is gradually decentralized. Consensus-critical protocol updates ("hard forks") will happen, though with rapidly decreasing frequency. Once the betanet stabilizes, our main cryptocurrency, the mel, will start trading on major cryptocurrency exchanges.
                </p>
                <p class="text--lead">
                    Finally, we plan our <b>stable release</b> some time in late 2020. This will permanently freeze the protocol specification, while permitting no consensus-critical updates unless to fix critical vulnerabilities. The betanet will shut down, with its history being entirely inherited.

Themelio Labs's focus will shift to developing a vibrant and flexible protocol stack, with Themelio-rooted security, for building both peer-to-peer and server-client networked apps. Of course, that's also where much of the money raised from selling mets will be going.
