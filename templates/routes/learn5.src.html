It is the execution environment where applications operate and can benefit from similar composability of general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum. This reduces protocol-application friction, increases speed, and improves efficiency of the application layer. </p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h3>Revisiting UXTO with MelVM</h3><h4>UXTO-based architectures are part of blockchain' canon, beginning with Bitcoin. Bitcoin introduced a coin-based UTXO model to track inputs and outputs of coins where covenants specify what sort of transactions can spend the coin. In contrast, many blockchains today like Ethereum use account-based models, through which they rely on 'smart contracts' to act as accounts owned by on-chain code. </h4><p>Themelio believes a coin-based UTXO architecture offers unique benefits over account-based models:</p><h4>Transactions can be processed in a freer order, increasing overall network throughput.</h4><p>Simpler state transitions provide clearer logic for faster dapp performance, simultaneously reducing bug frequency.</p><h4>More expressive UXTO architectures make it easier for developers to write dapps that can map event graphs.</h4><p>MelVM makes Themelio' UXTO-based architecture especially powerful. MelVM brings enhanced speed and efficiency to Themelio' coin-based UXTO model because apps see the coin state as a secure database they can freely query, without the need to download a huge and growing transaction history to operate. Themelio' novel approach enables coin-driven applications, ranging from simple wallets to complex covenant-driven apps, to scale without needing any centralized trust.</p></div></div></div><div class="section section--darken"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h2>Up next</h2><p>Applications on Themelio</p><p></p><h4></h4><p></p><h4></h4><p></p><p></p><ul><li><b></b><span></span></li><li><b></b><span></span></li></ul><p></p><p></p><span></span></div></div></div><div>Up Next: </div><div></div>}}
