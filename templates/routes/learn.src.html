Themelio is a blockchain built with one fundamental feature: immutability. The protocol can never be changed or upgraded, ensuring absolute trust by the developers and applications built on top that the architecture will always support decentralization and security.</p><h4>Introduction to Themelio</h4><p>Welcome to Themelio, the Root of Trust for Web3. Get familiar with the blockchain redefining trustless applications for the decentralized future.</p><h4>The Themelio Tech Stack</h4><p>Themelio's layer 1, standard protocols, and application layer work together to rebuild the foundation for trustless, decentralized use cases.</p><h4>MEL, the Trustless Stablecoin</h4><p>The Themelio ecosystem is powered by MEL, an algorithmic stablecoin not pegged to any global currency, but rather to on-chain activity.</p><h4>MEL, SYM, and Themelio's Tokenomics</h4><p>The MEL stablecoin retains its peg through the SYM token. Learn how Themelios tokenomics are redefining native blockchain currencies.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h2>What is Themelio?</h2><p>Themelio is a decentralized, public blockchain designed to serve as a low-level, stable, 
and radically simple base layer for an application ecosystem. 
Themelio's goal is to ensure endogenous trust, which can be achieved 
only through radical immutability. No governance process or developer
updates can change the Themelio blockchain once it is launched, ensuring unprecedented trust in any 
application or solution built on top.
Three overarching features enable Themelio to power a paradigm shift in Web3: an improved UXTO model, a novel PoS consensus mechanism, and an algorithmic stablecoin not pegged to any government currency.

Endogenous trust describes the ability to trust that a blockchain network will behave in a particular way without needing to trust or know who is running it. Among many of today's leading L1 blockchains, endogenous trust does not exist — protocols can be changed, updated, and altered through built-in mechanisms. Above all else, Themelio is architectured to endow the ecosystem built on top of it with endogenous trust. </p><a href="">Learn More</a></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h3>Themelio Use Cases</h3><p>Themelio's trustless architecture enables new paradigms for applications, use cases, and industries to be built.
