It is a public layer 1 blockchain designed to be low-level, simple, and stable through radical immutability. Themelio's architecture solves the problem of protocol-application friction, enabling a new wave of applications to be built on an ecosystem that benefits from endogenous trust that the underlying protocol will never change.\n Develop on Themelio's testnet and start validating, minting SYM, using the melwallet, and executing transactions.</p><a src="">Development Roadmap</a></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h2>2017</h2><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Q1 2019</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">Prototype client and network released.</p><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Q3 2020</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">Public launch of a non-persistent alphanet.</p><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Q2 2021</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">Public launch of a persistent betanet.</p><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Q1 2022</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">MEL and SYM token launch.</p><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Q1 2022</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">Public launch of Themelio mainnet.</p><h5 class="roadmap-titles">Work on Themelio begins.</h5><p class="roadmap-bodies">Subscribe and stay up to date with Themelio's development</p><p>&lt;Subscribe&gt;</p></div></div></div><div class="section section--darken"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h2>Themelio Stakeholders</h2><p>Stakeholders stake SYM to participate in Themelio's Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, Synkletos.

MelVM is Themelio's virtual machine, enabling complex functionality to be attached to coins on Themelio. Through MelVM, Themelio retains the benefits of coin-based protocols while also achieving the expression of general-purpose chains.</p><a src="">&lt;Introduction to MelVM&gt;</a></div></div></div>}}
