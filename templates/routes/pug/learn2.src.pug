    p Themelio is a minimal blockchain meaning it is designed to be as simple and immutable as possible. Though a minimal blockchain endows endogenous trust on a decentralized ecosystem, one disadvantage is limited functionality. Minimal blockchains, for example, lack powerful smart-contract systems.
    p A minimal blockchain like Themelio only makes sense in a richly-layered, multi-functional ecosystem that provides tools to developers and clean utility to users without requiring a compromise of the base protocol. Themelio's ecosystem is built to fit this model:

The protocols are designed to change with the evolving needs of Web3 applications.", "supports a growing ecosystem of dapps while relying on the underlying layer 1 to provide absolute trust, decentralization, and security.
