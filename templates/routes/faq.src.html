Its foundational technology is immutable, eradicating the need for any governance model that brings politics, instability, and avoidable complexity. Think of Themelio as the new Internet Protocol, reinvented for Web3. As a low-level application-neutral network protocol, Themelio provides developers a root of trust where they can build a nearly limitless range of intermediary protocols capable of powering a new world of applications. </p><a src="">Learn more: <Introduction to Themelio;; src=''></a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>What does 'Root of Trust' mean? What does 'endogenous trust' mean?</h3><p>A root of trust is the foundation on which all secure operations of a system depend. Endogenous trust means that the trust originates from and perpetuates from within the system itself, not from trust in the operators of the system. Themelio is a root of trust for a new paradigm of blockchain-based systems because it can promise endogenous trust to its users. This is achieved through radical simplicity and immutability. There are no protocol politics and no need to ever trust another party. Themelio is a simple, secure base layer that doesn't change. </p><a src="">Learn more: <Endogenous Trust;; src=''>, a New Paradigm</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>Is Themelio a layer 1 blockchain?</h3><p>Yes. Themelio is a layer 1 blockchain that does one thing  provides robust low-level functionality critical to secure decentralized apps  and does so very well. Its design is firmly centered around decoupling the blockchain from user-facing applications, unlike other layer 1 protocols which suffer from 'protocol-application.' The core blockchain logic is much simpler than other general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum and Tezos, employing immutability and therefore eliminating the need for governance.</p><a src="">Learn more: Themelio's Tech Stack</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>Who built Themelio?</h3><p>The team behind Themelio is a group of engineers, cryptographers, academics, and blockchain experts committed to building the most sustainable solutions for Web3. Eric Dong is the founder of Themelio, a computer security researcher and entrepreneur who previously created Geph, a VPN project that focuses on defeating censorship. Growing up between China and Canada, he is passionate about technology that enables a more open, decentralized, and secure Internet. </p><p> Other team members include Meade Kirke, a self-taught hacker, pure and simple. He has worked with startups and major global clients alike, as well as published books on Rust compiler. He is a coinsseir of end-to-end encryption. </p><a src="">Meet Themelio</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>Is Themelio live?</h3><p>Themelio is still in development, currently in betanet (as of Nov. 2021). The Themelio mainnet is set to launch XX-XX-XXXX. This means that although the tooling is far from complete, we have a feature-complete persistent mainnet and testnet running. As a stakeholder ('validator'), you can participate today by running a thin client or full node. As a developer, you can begin testing Themelio's core tooling like minting tokens, using the wallet, and executing transactions.</p><a src="">Become a stakeholder or start testing.</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>Is Themelio Proof of Stake?</h3><p>Yes, Themelio operates off a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism known as Synkletos. Synkletos not only serves to incentivize good behavior among stakeholders (also known as 'validators' in other PoS chains), but also serves a critical role in moderating the supply of SYM, one of Themelio's native tokens.</p><a src="">Learn more about Synkletos. </a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>How can I learn more about Themelio?</h3><p>The best way to learn about Themelio is to check out the 'Learn Themelio' section of the site  start here!</p><a src="">You can also follow us along here:</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>| Blog | Discord | Twitter | LinkedIn |</h3><p>How can I join the Themelio community?</p><a src="">There are lots of ways! Our Discord channel is where updates are posted, questions are answered, and the team waxes philosophy. Join us. 
 You can also find us on our blog, Twitter, and LinkedIn.</a></div><div class="faq-item"><h3>How can I contact the Themelio team?</h3><p>The best way to get in touch with the Themelio team is to join Discord and contact us there!</p><a src="">MEL and SYM Tokens</a></div></div></div></div><div>What are MEL and SYM?</div><div>MEL and SYM are the symbiotic tokens that fuel Themelio. MEL and SYM are interdependent, and both critical to unlocking Themelio's unique, trustless model. MEL is a fully decentralized low-volatility currency with a dynamic supply that can be liquidated for SYM tokens, the staking utility that undermines all activity on the Themelio network. </div>}}
