Though a minimal blockchain endows endogenous trust on a decentralized ecosystem, one disadvantage is limited functionality. Minimal blockchains, for example, lack powerful smart-contract systems.</p><p>A minimal blockchain like Themelio only makes sense in a richly-layered, multi-functional ecosystem that provides tools to developers and clean utility to users without requiring a compromise of the base protocol. Themelio's ecosystem is built to fit this model:</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><div>Themelio Application Layer</div><div>Themelio Standard Protocols</div><div>Themelio Layer 1</div></div></div></div><div class="section section--darken"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><div><b class="mr-1">Themelio's Layer 1</b><span>is the simplest and most immutable part of the stack, providing endogenous trust to the ecosystem as a whole.
