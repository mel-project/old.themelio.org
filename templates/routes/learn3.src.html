A trustless stablecoin, the price of MEL is pegged to a recurring, known computational value of the Themelio blockchain rather than to a fiat currency like USD.</p><p>MEL is pegged to a unit of measurement known as day of sequential computation (DOSC). DOSC tracks the cost of 24 hours of sequential computation at the present time. </p><h4>SYM: the Proof of Stake Token </h4><p>SYM is the complementary token of Themelio, and plays a crucial role in networkâs Proof of Stake and in the minting of MEL. Every block, 1 SYM token is generated, totaling ~1.05m SYM per year. To participate as a stakeholder, you must stake at least 1,000 SYM for a minimum of 500k blocks.</p><p>Unlike MEL, SYMâs price is free to fluctuate as the market demands.</p><h3>Melmint: Ensuring Trustless Stability</h3><p>MEL and SYM work together to ensure Themelioâs dual token system remains stable through a process known as Melmint.</p><p>The cost of a DOSC within a network like Themelio can be verified through non-interactive proofs, a branch of zero knowledge cryptography. DOSC can then be represented on-chain as a token (DOSC) that has a fluctuating exchange rate with SYM. Then, MEL is pegged to 1 DOSC worth of SYM.</p><p>To achieve this, Melmint (technically âMelmint v2â) uses Melswap, a basic token-swap market modeled after Uniswap v1. Melswap can support any MEL-X token pair, including MEL/SYM and MEL/DOSC. Melmint monitors the MEL/DOSC and SYM/DOSC pools, determining the proper MEL/SYM exchange rate from each tokenâs relative value against 1 DOSC.</p><p>The Melmint v2 specification can be reviewed in more detail here.</p></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="section__inner container"><div class="col text--lead"><h3>Why two currencies?</h3><p>Many blockchains that operate with PoS architectures use their underlying currencies to power staking, such as ETH. Themelio has chosen a different route, establishing SYM as the staking vehicle and MEL as the fundamental network currency. This is because coins used as stake are equity shares, and equity shares are a very inefficient form of money.</p><p>Equity share demand is driven largely by speculation for future cash flow. In the case of blockchains, this is largely correlated with an estimate of a networkâs future transaction fees. Cash on the other hand is valued in real-time as a medium of exchange. No blockchain network should require the users of everyday money to simultaneously speculate on the future transaction fees of the underlying network. </p><p>The solution? Two currencies. SYM is used for the role of equity stake, and MEL is used as everyday stable money for the ecosystem.</p></div></div></div><div>Up Next: </div><div>Synkletos: Proof of Stake </div>}}
